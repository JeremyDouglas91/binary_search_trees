# binary_search_trees

The purpose of this assignment was to compare the time complexity of the search algorithm in Binary Search Tree and AVL Tree data structures. The AVL Trees balancing property makes it's search algorithm more efficient on average. 

Graphs comparing the time complexity of both algorithms:
